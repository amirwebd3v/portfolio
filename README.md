# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description
This project involves creating a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. It is designed as a practice exercise to enhance my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website will include multiple sections such as an About Me, a Projects gallery, a Contact form, Skills, and Testimonials. Each section will be styled using CSS to create a visually appealing layout, and JavaScript will be used to add interactivity, such as scrolling, Light and Dark mode, and swipping.

## Key Features
