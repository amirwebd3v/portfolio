          I have maintained, developed and launched multiple projects from
          scratch, handling the development of their back-end and front-end
          codebases.
          <br />
          My current toolset is composed of JavaScript & TypeScript (including
          Node.js), React, Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS CDK, Pulumi or Terraform.
          <br />
          Lately, I am also finding myself using low-code / no-code tools more
          and more, such as Plasmic and Xano. These tools can deliver projects
          of great quality while allowing for much greater flexibility, at a
          fraction of the usual cost.

          If your initial thought is that I canâ€™t be the best in everything,
          it's okay. Send the design job to someone else, I will take care of
          all the code development or any other role you see me best suited for.
